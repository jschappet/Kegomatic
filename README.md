This is a project copied from Adafruit, thanks guys

## Purpose
After the second time, my iron filter broke I decided I needed to moniter the amount of water it was ejecting.
A little googling lead me to this handy flow meter.
It was easy to setup and adapt to my purposes.

## Parts

1. Raspberry Pi
1. (Flow meter)[link here]
